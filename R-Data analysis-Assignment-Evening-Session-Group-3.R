# === use case start ======= 
# Exploratory Data Analysis using R
# Objective:
# From this assignment we learnt how to apply our learning in R to analyze a dataset effectively. 
# We used key techniques such as creating and manipulating data frames, slicing, sampling, utilizing # apply-family functions (apply, lapply, sapply, mapply), performing summary operations (mean, # sum etc), and visualizing data to derive insights.# Steps: 
# 1. Importing a Dataset from a pre-existing dataset (iris,) from Râ€™s built-in datasets 
# 2. Manipulate data frames 
# 3. Slicing 
# 4. Sampling 
# 5. Utilize apply-family functions (apply, lapply, sapply, mapply) 
# 6. performing summary operations (mean, sum, median, max, min, frequwncy,...) 
# 7. Visualizing data to derive insights 
# Instructions 1.You are required to work on at least one dataset
#               2. Ensure your dataset has at least 4 columns and 50 rows, including numerical and categorical data.

# Load the necessary libraries need by the entire script
library(dplyr)  # For data manipulation
library(ggplot2)  # For visualization

# Task 1 create/Import a Dataset
df <- read.csv("/Users/edison-mel/Desktop/Edison/UR-ACED/Programming For Data Scientits/Learn-R/employee_data.csv")
# check the number of rows and column of a dataframe and confirm if it meeting the criteti
cat("This dataframe has",nrow(df),"rows and",ncol(df),"columns") # 6 columns and 914 rows
## print the top 5 rows of the dataframe and check if has columns required
head(df,n=3)

# Task 2 Slicing
## Extract specific rows and columns based on conditions. we have applied the following filter for the 
## purpose of exploring the dataframe in deep

## Filter rows where salary is greater than 50000
high_salary_df <- df[df$salary > 600000, ]
high_salary_df
cat('From this dataframe we have',nrow(high_salary_df),'with salary above 600,000')

## Filter rows where age is between 16 and 35 ( this is considered as youth in context of Rwanda)
youth_people_df <- df[df['age'] >= 18 & df['age'] <= 35,]
youth_people_df
cat('From this dataframe we have',nrow(youth_people_df),'youth peaple(age between 16 and 35')

## Find employees with high scores in a specific year 
top_performers_df <- df[df$score >= 80 & df$year == 2013, ]
top_performers_df
## Display a custom message to the console
cat('In 2013 we have',nrow(top_performers_df),'exceeding score of 80')

# Task 3 Sampling:
## Randomly select a subset of rows from the dataset.
## Select a random sample of 10 rows.

random_10_rows <-  sample(1:nrow(df), size=10) # sample 10 rows
random_10_rows_df <- df[random_10_rows,]  # generate a dataframe of the corresponding sample

## Display a custom message to the console
cat('The sampled dataset has',nrow(random_10_rows_df))

# Task 3 Apply-family Functions
## 3.1 apply: Apply a function across rows or columns.

# Let slice all numerical columns in our data apply-family functions
df_numeric <- df[, sapply(df, is.numeric) & names(df) != "year"] # this return age salary score columns only
df_numeric

## compute column wise mean
cols_mean <- apply(df_numeric, 2, mean) # Sum of each column, 2 represent row margin
cols_mean
## Display a custom message to the console
cat('The average is',cols_mean[['age']],'Average salary is',cols_mean['salary'],'Finally average score is',cols_mean['score'])


# 3.2 lapply(): Compute range for each numeric column
# use range function returns a list with min and max for each column
## this is crucial to understand the variation of values within a column
col_min_max <- lapply(df_numeric, range)

# 3.3 sapply(): Summarize numeric columns with multiple statistics
# Transforms list output to matrix/vector for easier reading

# Define a function to calculate summary statistics for a column

# 3.4 mapply(): Combine multiple columns using custom function
# Example: Create a new column combining age and salary
# Define a function to calculate the combined metric
calculate_combined_metric <- function(age, salary) {
  # Compute the product of age and salary, divided by 1000
  age * salary / 1000
}

# Use mapply to apply the function element-wise to two columns (age and salary)
